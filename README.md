## <span style="font-size:larger;">Disease Prediction with 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</span>

## <span style="font-size:larger;">Overview</span>
This project utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to predict diseases from CT scan images. With the increasing availability of medical imaging data, there is a growing need for efficient and accurate methods to assist in disease diagnosis and prognosis. By leveraging the power of deep learning, we aim to develop a model that can automatically detect and classify diseases from CT scans, providing valuable insights for medical professionals.

## <span style="font-size:larger;">Model Architecture</span>
The core of our approach is a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a powerful deep learning architecture capable of learning spatial and temporal features directly from volumetric data. The model is designed to extract hierarchical representations from CT scan volumes, enabling effective disease prediction.

The architecture of the 3D CNN typically includes multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers for feature extraction and spatial downsampling. Additional layers such as batch normalization and dropout may be incorporated to improve training stability and prevent overfitting. The final layers consist of fully connected layers and softmax activation for disease classification.

## <span style="font-size:larger;">Training Process</span>
The training process involves feeding the labeled CT scan images into the 3D CNN model and optimizing the model parameters to minimize the prediction error. We employ techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam optimization algorithm to update the network weights iteratively. During training, we monitor performance metrics such as accuracy, loss, and validation scores to assess model performance and prevent overfitting.

To enhance the generalization ability of the model, we may employ data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to increase the diversity of the training data. Furthermore, transfer learning approaches may be explored by fine-tuning pre-trained models on related tasks or domains.

## <span style="font-size:larger;">Conclusion</span>
By deploying a 3D CNN, we aim to create an accurate and efficient tool for disease prediction from CT scans, ultimately improving patient care.
